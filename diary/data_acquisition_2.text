Data Acquisition II: Database Storage

Overview:
After acquiring and cleaning the raw CSV datasets (Air Quality, Demographics, Cancer, and Income), the next step was to store the data in the database. 
I chose to use an SQLite database (aqi_project.db) because it integrates seamlessly with Python and Pandas, and allows for efficient SQL querying.

Database Schema:
- Primary table: counties. This is the central table. It contains the fips code as the Primary Key, along with county_name and state_name.
- Secondary tables: demographics, air_quality, health, income.
- Relationship: Each secondary table uses the fips code as a Foreign Key that connects directly back to the counties table.
