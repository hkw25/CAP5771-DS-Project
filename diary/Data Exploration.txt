1. Correlation Heatmap: 
The heatmap shows that the corrleation bwtween mdeian air quality and cancer rate, and the corrleation bwtween mdeian air quality and median income 
are extremely low. It suggests that public health outcomes like cancer are highly multifactorial, factors like median age, genetics, and historical 
pollution exposure will likely play larger roles than a single year's AQI snapshot. Furthermore, the weak correlation between income and AQI indicates 
that geographical environmental hazards, like wildfires or industrial zones can impact regions regardless of their median wealth.

2. Box Plot:
This visualization highlights the variance in environmental stability. While the median AQI might be similar across tiers, the "Low Income" tier typically 
exhibits a wider box. This suggests that lower-income counties are subject to much more volatile and unpredictable spikes in poor air quality compared to 
the more stable environments of high-income counties.

3. Histogram:
The data reveals that on the left side of the graph demonstrates that the vast majority of U.S. counties maintain a healthy, low Median AQI, typically under 45. 
However, from the right, we can see there are some extreme outlier counties that suffer from severe environmental pollution.

4. Scatter Plot:
A moderate correlation here indicates that income alone does not perfectly predict air quality, prompting the need to look at other variables 
such as population density.
